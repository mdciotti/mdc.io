I am a student pursuing a degree in computer science, with a focus on computational mathematics. I love learning about and playing with technology, as well as how it merges with interactive design. Many of my [experiments](/lab/) represent this intersection of science and design, and I recommend checking them out! While programming is my go-to hobby, I also enjoy casual gaming, exploring the outdoors, and for some odd reason, cooking.

To see what I've been thinking about most recently, head over to my [journal](/journal/)!

You can also either view my résumé [online as HTML](/resume/) or [download it as PDF](/resume/maxwell-ciotti.pdf).
