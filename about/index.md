Hello! I am a student pursuing a degree in computer science, with a focus on computational mathematics. I love learning about and playing with technology, especially how it converges with interactive design. Many of my [experiments](/lab/) represent this intersection of science and design, so if you're curious go check them out! While programming and designing are my go-to hobbies, I also enjoy casual gaming, photography, exploring the outdoors, inventing/building, drawing, and for some odd reason, cooking.

To see what I've been thinking about most recently, head over to my [journal](/journal/)! You can also subscribe to my entries to receive them as I post them with [RSS](/journal/feed.xml).

My **résumé** is available to view [online as HTML](/resume/) or to [download as PDF](/resume/maxwell-ciotti.pdf).

If you have any questions or are just feeling social, [email me](mailto:max@mdc.io).
