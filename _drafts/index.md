# Hey, I'm Maxwell

I am a student and frontend developer. I also design websites, apps, and other digital media. Most of my time is spent obsessing over the small details on my experiments. I enjoy indie games, mountain biking, rocketry, and oddly enough, cooking. Still curious? [Discover more about me](/about).
