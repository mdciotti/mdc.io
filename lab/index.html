<h2>Lab Experiments</h2>
<p>A complete index of my lab experiments</p>

<p>In my spare time I enjoy exploring miscellaneous mathematical or computer-science related topics that tend to consume my mind for a while through programming and visualization. More code and projects can be found at my <a href="https://github.com/mdciotti">GitHub profile</a>.</p>

<p class="soft"><em>Please note: many of these experiments have not been tested for cross-browser support.</em></p>
