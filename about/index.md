Hello! I am a fourth-year **student pursuing a degree in computer science** and mathematics. My research interests include scientific visualization, simulation, robotics control, and artificial intelligence.

- I **design and develop websites** and user interfaces for fun. This is how I was introduced to programming, and it never seems to get old.
- I'm always discovering and toying with technology, especially how it converges with interactive design. Along with programming and designing, I also enjoy photography, hiking, inventing, casual gaming, and cooking.
- I'm **enthusastic about** scientific discovery and innovation, especially in terms of **space exploration**. My dream is to help humanity push the bounds of our understanding of and place within the universe.

To see what I've been thinking about most recently, head over to my [journal](/journal/)! You can also [subscribe]({{ site.feed }}) to receive entries as I post them. For less constructed thoughts, [follow @mdciotti on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mdciotti).

My **résumé** is available to [view as HTML](/resume/) or to [download as PDF](/resume/maxwell-ciotti.pdf).

I am currently **available for a research-based internship** for the summer of 2017. Contact me [via hire@mdc.io](mailto:hire@mdc.io) for inquiries.
