# Maxwell Ciotti
(Almost) all you ever wanted to know about me

<div class="picture"></div>

Hello! I am a student pursuing a degree in computer science, with a focus on computational mathematics. I love learning about and playing with technology, especially how it converges with interactive design. Many of my [experiments](/lab/) represent this intersection of science and design, so if you're curious go check them out! While programming and designing are my go-to hobbies, I also enjoy casual gaming, photography, exploring the outdoors, inventing, building, drawing, and for some odd reason, cooking.

To see what I've been thinking about most recently, head over to my [journal](/journal/)! You can also [subscribe]({{ site.feed }}) to receive entries as I post them. For less constructed thoughts, [follow @mdciotti on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mdciotti).

My **résumé** is available to [view as HTML](/resume/) or to [download as PDF](/resume/maxwell-ciotti.pdf).

[Email me@mdc.io](mailto:me@mdc.io) with any questions or if you just want to say hi.
